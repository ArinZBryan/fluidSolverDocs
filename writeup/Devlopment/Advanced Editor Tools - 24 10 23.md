[*Advanced Editor Tools*](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/advanced-editor-tools-254203) is a package on the Unity Asset Store, that allows for easier testing and debugging of scripts while in the Unity editor. In this project it is primarily used to allow for otherwise complex features such as field folding and custom buttons to appear in the editor's representation of a `Monobehaviour`. This allows for greater organisation of controls and parameters as the list of such variables grows, and allows for the easy testing and running of functions, only otherwise triggerable by creating a keybind.
