### James Thompson - Video Editor
##### What formats would it be easiest to work with outside of this program?
> In terms of file formats, the easiest to work with is probably `.mov` and `.mp4`, most computers have codecs for those inbuilt, so they should be able to be worked with easily. In terms of image files, `.png`, `.jpg` and `.bmp` are best, though, if you're using uncompressed bitmap images, it might best to limit the file size, as those can be absolutely massive. In general, videos are nice to work with, but image sequences are fine as well, especially as the images can be uncompressed, so any fine details can be kept in, in case I need to work with it after the fact.
##### What parts of the UI of the products you work with do you like?
> Primarily, I use *Da Vinci Resolve*, and the tabs at the bottom are quite nice. They separate the different concerns quite nicely and keep everything where I expect it to be. The sidebars on the different effects is also quite handy, it's separated into neat sections, which means it's generally easy to find what you need.

##### What parts of the UI of the products you work with don't you like?
> Sometimes the dropdown menus at the top of *Da Vinci Resolve* can be quite cluttered. Seems to be quite common amongst programs using that design pattern. Maybe, if you've got a place for everything else somewhere else, that might be better.

##### What kind of hardware are you using?
> In my computer? It's a couple years old, but I think it's got an *i7* of some description and a mid-range graphics card from the time. I don't pay much attention to it, it's never really been an issue.

##### How would you choose to customise the look of the simulation?
> It'd be good if there was a way to have it output black and white images, not that I don't trust your ability to make it look interesting, but if it were able to do that, then I can add all sorts of custom effects myself. The programs to do that are really mature, and I use them often. I can attach all sorts of masks and particle effects to a black and white image as a mask, not that I'd complain if there were some more basic particle effects and colour options when I need to go quickly.

### Sam Clarke - Digital Artist (2D)
##### What formats would it be easiest to work with outside of my program?
> I mostly work with still images, so video formats aren't much of a concern for me. Mostly, what would be useful would be to have a nice range of image formats. `.png` and `.jpg` are fine, but the compression on them means they only really look good when there isn't much detail. I'd prefer if there was at least one uncompressed format, though it does need to be able to be opened by *Photoshop* at the very least.

##### What parts of the UI of the products you work with do you like?
> Having all the tools down the side of the window is nice, everything in one place. Though, when I'm in the 'flow', so so speak it really helps to have keybinds for everything. They take a while to learn, but once you do, you don't even really have to think about it. If you make sure they're on keys you'd expect though, that'd make them easier to learn.
##### What parts of the UI of the products you work with don't you like?
> *Photoshop* has so many pop-up windows and dialogs. Sometimes even simple things can just be hidden in the most random places behind layers and layers of menus and dialogs and more menus. Some of them are even contextual!
##### What kind of hardware are you using?
> Just a *Macbook Pro*, oh and a drawing tablet if you count that. Its not exactly the newest, but I think I bought it sometime around 2020.
##### How would you choose to customise the look of the simulation?
> Mostly, I'd want to draw over any images of the simulation. Unless you can have some way to make it look really stylised, and completely customisable, then it might just be easier for the both of us if I can just paste it in as a layer, and tweak and edit it as needed. If you're doing that, then it would also need to be able to have a transparent background, so I don't have to attempt to get rid of it myself.

### Sebastian Gothard - Game Developer

##### What formats would it be easiest to work with outside of my program?
> I'd mostly use something like this for background elements. If the player's interacting with it, then it needs to be really quite high fidelity, and it needs to interact precisely with the physics engine. But for background elements, I guess it'd be nice to have it as a `.gif`, as they can generally be imported pretty easily. Actually, having it as a spritesheet would be nice as well, they're pretty quick to load, and loads of game engines support using them.
##### What parts of the UI of the products you work with do you like?
> Having lots of panels that I can move around and customise to my liking is nice, but I have quite a tendency to rearrange them and fiddle with how it looks when I should really be getting on with things a little more important. I's a nice thing to have, but I wouldn't really miss it if it weren't there.
##### What parts of the UI of the products you work with don't you like?
> It seems like there are a million different ways to do the same thing in *Unity*. There's one button in a nested menu off the title bar, there's another in a different looking menu in two of the panels. *And* you can right click on some of the panels to get a ginormous long menu practically as tall as the screen, and somewhere within that is a dropdown to do the same thing! Please, just give me one way to get things done.
##### What kind of hardware are you using?
> In the early stages of lots of my games, they can be *really* unoptimized, so I generally need to have quite a powerful CPU and GPU. But that's mostly just for game development. Of course not everyone has such a beastly computer, so I've got a computer much more in line with the average game player.
> 	*What's that then?*
> Four cores, hyperthreading, an RTX 3050 class card. Nothing too special really.
##### How would you choose to customise the look of the simulation?
> Really, there are a few main simulations that I'd use. Explosions, fire, dust spreading out, smoke, maybe even something moving through fog. Other than than that, I'd not use much else. I *might* use some of the more wacky options, but I doubt they'd be used with any sort of frequency.

### Conclusions
- What formats would it be easiest to work with outside of this program?
	- `.png`, `.jpg`, `.bmp` and `.gif` are the image file formats needed
	- `.mp4`, `.mov` and `.gif` are the video file formats needed.
	- Spritesheets may be useful.
- What parts of the UI of the products you work with do you like?
	- Separating functions by tabs in otherwise unused areas of the screen allows for easy organisation if functions in the user's mind
	- Good keybinds are important to allow for speedy use of the program
- What parts of the UI of the products you work with don't you like?
	- Avoid cluttering drop-downs and menus with only tenuously related items
	- Try not to hide anything away in pop-ups that are not needed.
	- Try to avoid duplicating and options or menus. Leave only one method to do something in the UI.
- What kind of hardware are you using?
	- A build for MacOS (darwin) is required
	- Minimum hardware targeted should be a lower-mid range modern CPU or some more high end CPUs from a few years ago. A low-end GPU requirement is also something to aim for.
- How would you choose to customise the look of the simulation?
	- Ensure a transparent background is an option
	- Ensure a black-and-white mode is an option
	- Customisation presets needed:
		- Fire
		- Explosions
		- Dust
		- Smoke
